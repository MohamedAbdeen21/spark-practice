# spark-practice

The Spark directory contains a jupyter notebook. I connected to a PostgreSQL database and used a subset of the data scraped by the [News-Recommender](https://github.com/mohamedabdeen21/news-recommender) project I made. 

The analysis include number of articles per domain, number of articles per day and most common words/topics. 

The Spark Streaming directory contains a python socket to send data to Spark, the classic word count example and a censoring script.
